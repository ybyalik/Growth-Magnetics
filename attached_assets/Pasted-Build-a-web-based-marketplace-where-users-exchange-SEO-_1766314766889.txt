Build a web-based marketplace where users exchange SEO value (Backlinks or Brand Mentions) using a "Credit" currency. The platform is heavily curated: Users submit websites, an Admin rates them, and an Admin must approve every completed job before credits are transferred.
Tech Stack Preference: Python (Flask), SQLite (for now), Bootstrap 5 (Frontend).
1. The Core "Asset" Logic (Supply Side)
Users cannot simply sign up and start selling links. They must onboard their "Assets" (Websites).
User Submission: A user adds a website (Domain Name) to their profile.
Pending State: The site defaults to a PENDING_REVIEW status. It cannot be used to earn credits yet.
Admin Valuation:
The Admin views the pending site.
The Admin manually assigns metrics: Industry (e.g., Tech), DR (Domain Rating), Traffic, and Quality Tier.
Credit Value: The Admin sets a specific "Earning Power" for the site (e.g., "This site earns 50 Credits per link").
Activation: Once the Admin approves, the site becomes ACTIVE in the user's "My Assets" tab.
2. The "Order" Logic (Demand Side)
Buyers create "Campaigns" (Orders) to spend their credits.
Campaign Inputs:
Target URL: The page they want to boost.
Target Keyword/Brand: The anchor text or brand name to verify.
Type: Boolean choice: Hyperlink OR Unlinked Brand Mention.
Placement Format: Guest Post (New Article) OR Niche Edit (Existing Content).
Quantity: Number of links needed (e.g., 5).
Publisher Notes: Text area for specific instructions (e.g., "No AI content").
The "Blind" Feed:
Orders appear on a public "Earn Credits" board.
Privacy Rule: The Feed shows Industry, Format, and Credit Reward. It hides the Target URL and Keyword.
The "Bucket" System: If a user wants 5 links, the order stays on the feed until all 5 slots are filled.
3. The Fulfillment Workflow (The Transaction)
Reservation: A Seller (with an approved Asset) views the feed. They click "Reserve Slot."
Constraint: They can only reserve if their Asset matches the Buyer's requirements (e.g., Industry match).
Reveal: Once reserved, the Target URL and Notes are revealed to the Seller.
Submission: The Seller publishes the content on their site and submits the Proof URL to the platform.
Admin Holding Tank:
The status changes to PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL.
Crucial: Credits are NOT transferred yet.
Final Approval:
The Admin reviews the work.
If Approved: Credits move from Buyer to Seller. Order slot is marked "Complete."
If Rejected: Seller is notified to fix it, or the slot is reopened for someone else.
4. User Dashboard Requirements
The user interface needs two main sections:
Tab A: "My Assets"
A list of websites the user owns.
Shows their Status (Pending/Active) and their assigned "Credit Value."
Tab B: "Exchange History"
A ledger of all jobs done.
Columns: Date, Type (Given vs. Received), Counterpart Domain (only visible after deal), Target URL, Status (Live/Review/Rejected), and Credit Amount.
5. Admin Panel Requirements
A dedicated route (/admin) to manage the economy:
Site Queue: List of new sites waiting for valuation/approval.
Job Queue: List of completed link jobs waiting for final quality check and credit release.
User Management: Ability to manually add/remove credits from users (for support/sales).
