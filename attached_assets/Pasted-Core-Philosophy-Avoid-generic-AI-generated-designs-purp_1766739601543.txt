Core Philosophy:
Avoid generic AI-generated designs (purple/blue gradients, Inter/Roboto fonts, centered boxes). Create distinctive, human-crafted designs with intentional aesthetic choices that match your product's purpose.
Typography:

NEVER use: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, Space Grotesk, Poppins, system fonts
Use Google Fonts with distinctive pairings:

Headings: Playfair Display, Syne, JetBrains Mono, Archivo Black, Cormorant, Bitter
Body: Montserrat, Nunito, Public Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, Source Serif Pro



Color Strategy:

Avoid purple gradients (#667eea to #764ba2) and generic blues
Create intentional palettes based on purpose (e.g., financial = navy/forest green, creative = sunset oranges/teals)
Build depth with variations (50, 100, 500, 700, 900 shades)
Use warm off-whites instead of pure white, warm darks instead of pure black

Layout Principles:

Break from centered boxes - use asymmetric grids (grid-cols-12 with offset columns)
Overlap elements with negative margins
Use generous whitespace OR controlled density (never medium)
Add subtle diagonal elements (-2deg to 2deg rotations)

Next.js Optimizations:

Always use <Image> from next/image, never <img>
Add metadata for SEO in every page
Use next/font for automatic font optimization with display: 'swap'
Place images in /public with absolute paths

Replit-Specific:

Set run command: npm run dev
Scripts needed: dev, build, start, deploy
All assets in /public folder

Execution Checklist:

Distinctive fonts (not generic)
Intentional, context-specific colors
Asymmetric layouts that break from boxes
3+ unique visual details
Meaningful animations
Clear aesthetic point of view
Comprehensive SEO metadata

Avoid:

Centered hero with purple gradient
Three-column feature grids with icons
Generic blue "Get Started" buttons
Same border-radius everywhere
Everything centered and symmetrical

Process:

Define aesthetic direction in writing first
Choose distinctive typography
Build intentional color palette
Design hero that establishes visual language
Create core components following that language
Expand while maintaining consistency
