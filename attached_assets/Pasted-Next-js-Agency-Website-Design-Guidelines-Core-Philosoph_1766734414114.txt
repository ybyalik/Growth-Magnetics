Next.js Agency Website Design Guidelines
Core Philosophy:
Avoid generic agency websites (purple/blue gradients, Inter/Roboto fonts, centered hero sections). Create distinctive, human-crafted designs that showcase your agency's expertise and creative capabilities.
Typography:

NEVER use: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, Space Grotesk, Poppins, system fonts
Use Google Fonts with distinctive pairings that reflect agency personality:

Creative/Editorial Agency: Playfair Display + Montserrat
Modern Tech Agency: Syne + Public Sans
Bold/Disruptive Agency: Archivo Black + Plus Jakarta Sans
Refined/Luxury Agency: Cormorant + Source Serif Pro
Innovative/Unique Agency: Bitter + Nunito



Color Strategy:

Avoid purple gradients (#667eea to #764ba2) and generic blues
Create intentional palettes based on agency positioning:

Creative agency: Bold jewel tones, unexpected color combos (coral + navy, mustard + forest)
Tech/Dev agency: Terminal greens, code blacks, neon accents
Marketing agency: Energetic oranges, confident reds, warm neutrals
Design agency: Sophisticated earth tones, muted pastels, rich blacks


Build depth with variations (50, 100, 500, 700, 900 shades)
Use warm off-whites instead of pure white, warm darks instead of pure black

Layout Principles for Agencies:

Break from centered boxes - use asymmetric grids showcasing work prominently
Create dynamic portfolio/case study layouts with overlapping elements
Feature large, bold imagery of your work (not stock photos)
Use generous whitespace OR controlled density (never medium)
Add subtle diagonal elements for energy and movement
Make CTAs feel natural, not pushy ("Let's Talk" vs "Get Started")

Agency-Specific Sections:

Hero: Bold statement about what makes you different, not generic taglines
Work/Portfolio: Feature 3-5 standout projects with compelling visuals
Process: Show how you work, not generic "Discovery → Design → Deploy" boxes
Team: Real people with personality, not corporate headshots in a grid
Services: Presented as outcomes/value, not bullet lists
Social Proof: Client logos, testimonials integrated naturally, not in boxes

Next.js Optimizations:

Always use <Image> from next/image, never <img> (critical for portfolio images)
Add metadata for SEO in every page
Use next/font for automatic font optimization with display: 'swap'
Place images in /public with absolute paths
Optimize case study images aggressively (they're your biggest visual asset)

Replit-Specific:

Set run command: npm run dev
Scripts needed: dev, build, start, deploy
All assets in /public folder
Use /public/portfolio for case study images

Execution Checklist:

Distinctive fonts that match agency personality
Intentional colors that stand out from competitors
Asymmetric layouts that showcase your best work
3+ unique visual details that demonstrate your design chops
Meaningful animations that don't feel gimmicky
Clear point of view (what you stand for)
Portfolio/work prominently featured with large imagery
Comprehensive SEO metadata
Fast load times (agencies should walk the walk)

Avoid These Agency Clichés:

Centered hero with "We Create Amazing Digital Experiences"
Three-column service grid with icon + heading + description
Generic blue "Let's Talk" buttons
Team photos in matching poses on gray background
"Our Process" with 4 numbered boxes
Client logo soup without context
Everything centered and symmetrical
Before/after sliders for every project

Agency-Specific Anti-Patterns:

Promising results you can't deliver ("10x your revenue!")
Corporate jargon ("synergy," "best-in-class," "innovative solutions")
Vague case studies without real metrics or outcomes
Stock photos instead of actual client work
Navigation with "Solutions" instead of "Services"

Process for Agency Site:

Define your positioning (what makes you different from other agencies?)
Choose typography that reflects your agency's personality
Build color palette that stands out in your market
Design hero that makes a bold statement about your POV
Create compelling work/portfolio section (this is your main selling point)
Build service pages that focus on outcomes, not features
Add social proof that feels natural and credible

Content Strategy:

Lead with your unique approach/methodology
Feature 3-5 best case studies with metrics and outcomes
Show real results, not aspirational promises
Let your work speak louder than your copy
Make it easy to contact you (multiple CTAs, but not aggressive)
